# Crypto-Chela: A Lightning Network Payment Activated Beer Faucet

Welcome to Crypto-Chela, an exciting project inspired by BitcoinBeer. Our project introduces a unique way of incorporating the emerging technology of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network into everyday life. We present to you a beer faucet that dispenses beer purchased with Bitcoin via Lightning Network payments. 

## Introduction

The Crypto-Chela project enables users to select their preferred volume of beer through a touch display. This selection generates a QR code invoice which, once paid, activates a valve to dispense the beer. The beer continues to flow until a flow meter verifies that the paid-for amount has been poured. This integration of Bitcoin, Lightning Network, and everyday amenities heralds a new step towards a cashless society.

## Functionality 

The user interface for the Crypto-Chela beer faucet was created using Python's tkinter. The application runs on a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a touch screen display, a valve, and a flow meter. These hardware elements work together seamlessly to deliver a user-friendly experience. 

Payments are managed through an external payment server running full nodes of Bitcoin and Lightning Network. This ensures a secure and efficient transaction process.

## Setup and Configuration

In order for the Crypto-Chela faucet to function correctly, it must connect to a private server. To establish this connection, you will need to modify the `Lightning.py` file with your own server details. Detailed instructions on how to do this are provided in the `Lightning.py` file itself.
